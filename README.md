### :question: What's this?
A bunch of endpoints with seemingly unrelated, but perhaps useful functionalities.

### Who can use this?
I made a similar project to perform tasks that I wanted an online service to do for me. This repository builds on top of that, and is an extension of the same.

I wrote this to carry out tasks that I didn't want to write the code for.

### Why not a library? Why an API?
If this had been a library, it would kinda defeat the purpose.
The aim here is to allow developers to write minimum code *inside* the application, and use external resources to do the heavy lifting. Of course this won't fit the use case for offline apps, but using it in an app that's always online, might not be a bad idea.
